All LTX-2 API requests require authentication using API keys. API keys are associated with your account and provide access to the API endpoints.

## Getting Your API Key

Sign in to the Developer Console to create your API key.

<Button href="https://console.ltx.video" intent="primary" icon="fa-solid fa-key">
  Create API Key
</Button>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request using the Bearer token format:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Example Request

<CodeBlock title="cURL">
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ltx.video/v1/text-to-video \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A majestic eagle soaring through clouds",
    "model": "ltx-2-pro",
    "duration": 8,
    "resolution": "1920x1080"
  }'
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="Python">
```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.ltx.video/v1/text-to-video",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "prompt": "A majestic eagle soaring through clouds",
        "model": "ltx-2-pro",
        "duration": 8,
        "resolution": "1920x1080"
    }
)
```
</CodeBlock>

## Security Best Practices

<Callout intent="warning">
**Keep your API key secure:**
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Don't expose keys in client-side code
- Use environment variables to store keys
- Rotate keys periodically
</Callout>

### Environment Variables

Store your API key in environment variables:

**Bash:**
```bash
export LTXV_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

**Python:**
```python
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("LTXV_API_KEY")
```

**Node.js:**
```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.LTXV_API_KEY;
```

## Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "message": "Invalid API key"
  }
}
```

Common authentication issues:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Missing authorization header | No `Authorization` header | Add the header to your request |
| Invalid API key | Key is incorrect or expired | Verify your API key |
| Malformed header | Incorrect format | Use `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` format |

## Rate Limits

API keys are subject to rate limits based on your plan. If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

Contact our team to discuss rate limit increases for your use case.

# Prompting Guide for LTX-2

To get the most out of the **LTX-2** model, a strong prompt makes all the difference. The key is painting a complete picture of the story you’re telling — one that flows naturally from beginning to end and covers all the elements the model needs to bring your vision to life.

If you’re new to writing prompts for video generation, this guide will help you construct effective, production-ready prompts.

## Table of Contents

  - [Example 2](#example-2)

---

## Key Elements to Include

When writing a prompt, aim to include the following elements:

### 1. Establish the Shot

Use cinematography terms that match your intended genre. Include shot scale or category-specific characteristics to refine the visual style.

### 2. Set the Scene

Describe lighting conditions, color palette, surface textures, and atmosphere to establish mood and tone.

### 3. Describe the Action

Write the core action as a natural sequence, flowing clearly from beginning to end.

### 4. Define the Character(s)

Include age, hairstyle, clothing, and distinguishing features. Express emotion through **physical cues**, not abstract labels.

### 5. Identify Camera Movement(s)

Specify how and when the camera moves. Describing how subjects appear _after_ the movement helps the model complete the motion accurately.

### 6. Describe the Audio

Clearly describe ambient sound, music, speech, or singing.

- Place spoken dialogue in **quotation marks**
- Specify language and accent if needed

---

## For Best Results

- Write your prompt as a **single flowing paragraph**
- Use **present tense** verbs for action and movement
- Match the level of detail to the shot scale  
  (close-ups need more detail than wide shots)
- Describe camera movement relative to the subject
- Aim for **4–8 descriptive sentences**
- Iterate freely — LTX-2 is designed for fast experimentation

## What to Avoid with LTX-2

| Avoid                     | Why It Doesn’t Work                                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internal emotional states | Use visual cues instead of labels like “sad” or “confused” |
| Text and logos            | Readable text is not currently reliable                    |
| Complex physics           | Chaotic motion can introduce artifacts (dancing is OK)     |
| Overloaded scenes         | Too many characters or actions reduce clarity              |
| Conflicting lighting      | Mixed light logic confuses scene interpretation            |
| Overcomplicated prompts   | Start simple and layer complexity gradually                |

## Sample Prompts

### Example 1

[![News video](https://vumbnail.com/1133134310.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1133134310)

**Prompt:**

_EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET – MORNING – LIVE NEWS BROADCAST
The shot opens on a news reporter standing in front of a row of cordoned-off cars, yellow caution tape fluttering behind him. The light is warm, early sun reflecting off the camera lens. The faint hum of chatter and distant drilling fills the air.
The reporter, composed but visibly excited, looks directly into the camera, microphone in hand.
Reporter (live):
“Thank you, Sylvia. And yes — this is a sentence I never thought I’d say on live television — but this morning, here in the quiet town of New Castle, Vermont… black gold has been found!”
He gestures slightly toward the field behind him.
Reporter (grinning):
“If my cameraman can pan over, you’ll see what all the excitement’s about.”
The camera pans right, slowly revealing a construction site surrounded by workers in hard hats. A beat of silence — then, with a sudden roar, a geyser of oil erupts from the ground, blasting upward in a violent plume.
Workers cheer and scramble, the black stream glistening in the morning light. The camera shakes slightly, trying to stay focused through the chaos.
Reporter (off-screen, shouting over the noise):
“There it is, folks — the moment New Castle will never forget!”
The camera catches the sunlight gleaming off the oil mist before pulling back, revealing the entire scene — the small-town skyline silhouetted against the wild fountain of oil._

### Example 2

[![Animation](https://vumbnail.com/1133134445.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1133134445)

**Prompt:**

_The camera opens in a calm, sunlit frog yoga studio. Warm morning light washes over the wooden floor as incense smoke drifts lazily in the air. The senior frog instructor sits cross-legged at the center, eyes closed, voice deep and calm. “We are one with the pond.” All the frogs answer softly: “Ommm...” “We are one with the mud.” “Ommm...” He smiles faintly. “We are one with the flies.” A pause.
The camera pans to the side towards one frog who twitches, eyes darting. Suddenly its tongue snaps out, catching a fly mid-air and pulling it into its mouth.
The master exhales slowly, still serene. “But we do not chase the flies...” Beat. “not during class.”
The guilty frog lowers its head in shame, folding its hands back into a meditative pose. The other frogs resume their chant: “Ommm...” Camera holds for a moment on the embarrassed frog, eyes closed too tightly, pretending nothing happened._
